# California Political Knowledge Map Context

Domain model for mapping political influence networks in California from scraped news articles and other public data sources into a knowledge graph.

## Language

**Source Article**:
A strongly-typed domain model representing a scraped news story or report containing political coverage and influence data.
_Avoid_: News piece, document, post, feed

**Article Chunk**:
A structured segment of a Source Article's text, representing a smaller, contiguous block used to optimize Entity Extraction and store vector embeddings.
_Avoid_: Fragment, snippet, text slice, part

**Extraction Prompt**:
The instructions and guidelines loaded from an external file (`extraction_prompt.txt`) and fed to the Language Model (LLM) to identify and structure nodes and relationships from a Source Article's text.
_Avoid_: Prompt, template, instruction set


**Entity Extraction**:
The process of identifying specific real-world entities (political actors, organizations, public policy measures) and the semantic relationships between them from unstructured article text.
_Avoid_: Named Entity Recognition, parsing, data extraction

**Influence Graph Playground**:
The interactive command-line interface implemented in `playground.py` used to execute prompt-guided entity extraction on Source Articles, enabling the user to inspect and refine the schema before Neo4j ingestion.
_Avoid_: Test environment, testing script, sandbox, trial run

**Graph Database Adapter**:
The database adapter protocol and its concrete implementation (Neo4jAdapter) that abstracts the Neo4j database, managing connections, index validation, and ingestion of Source Articles, Article Chunks, and Extracted Entities.
_Avoid_: Database manager, Neo4j client, direct driver wrapper



**Entity Resolution**:
The process of identifying, measuring semantic similarity between, and merging nodes that represent the same real-world political actor, organization, or measure.
_Avoid_: Deduplication, merging, cleaning, string matching

**Coreference Resolution**:
The process of resolving pronouns and referring expressions in a Source Article's text to their canonical entity names before or during Entity Extraction to prevent information loss across Article Chunks.
_Avoid_: Pronoun matching, reference linking

**Annotated Article**:
A Source Article that has been pre-processed to explicitly tag pronouns and referring expressions with their canonical entity targets using markup (e.g. `<ref>` tags).
_Avoid_: Tagged text, parsed story

**Coreference Critic**:
An LLM agent that reviews and validates the annotated coreferences in an Annotated Article to ensure semantic accuracy and prevent incorrect reference mapping before chunking.
_Avoid_: Critic agent, checker, validator

**Story Pipeline**:
A synchronous pipeline coordinator that orchestrates the coreference resolution, chunking, embedding generation, entity extraction, and persistence steps for a Source Article.
_Avoid_: Ingestion runner, story processor

**Pipeline Result**:
A structured domain model returning the outcome of a Story Pipeline execution, containing the processed chunks and extracted entities (useful for dry runs and validation).
_Avoid_: Processing report, output dict

**Embedding Adapter**:
The adapter protocol and its concrete implementation that handles vector embedding calculations and dimension checks for Article Chunks.
_Avoid_: Embedder helper, vector utility

**Coreference Adapter**:
The adapter protocol and its concrete implementation that handles pronoun resolution and entity tagging on a Source Article.
_Avoid_: Resolver wrapper, coref helper

**Entity Extraction Adapter**:
The adapter protocol and its concrete implementation that extracts entities and relationships from Article Chunks.
_Avoid_: Extractor model, agent helper
